# Randomized Hitsounds
Randomized Hitsounds for Team Fortress 2</br>
Template by **Luna** / Everything else by **Valve**

# How to use?

* First download the files from here (or releases on the right side)</br>
* Extract files into custom folder</br>
* Drop your hitsounds into the `sounds` folder and name them accordingly.</br>

The naming goes as follows:

```ruby
hitsound1.wav
hitsound2.wav
hitsound3.wav
hitsound4.wav
hitsound5.wav
```

If you want more than 5 sounds, you'll have to edit the file in `scripts`</br>
Instructions are inside `game_sounds_weapons.txt`

# Possible Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Sounds not working/only one sound plays | Conflict issue, check if you have old hitsounds installed somewhere |
| Sounds are glitchy/earrape | Delete every .cache file in `custom` that you can find. Can also be a solution to `Issue #1` |
